"Credit Card Fraud Detection" refers to identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card usage. Typically, this involves analyzing transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity using machine learning or statistical methods.

If you're looking to build a project, hereâ€™s a high-level roadmap:


---

ğŸ“Š 1. Dataset Collection

You can use publicly available datasets:

Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection

> Contains anonymized transaction data with class labels (0 = valid, 1 = fraud)





---

ğŸ§¹ 2. Data Preprocessing

Handle class imbalance (fraudulent transactions are <1% of total)

Techniques: SMOTE, undersampling, oversampling


Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)

Split into training/testing sets



---

ğŸ§  3. Model Selection

Try different models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees / Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Neural Networks

Autoencoders (for anomaly detection)



---

ğŸ“ˆ 4. Evaluation Metrics

Due to data imbalance, use:

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix


Avoid using accuracy alone.


---

ğŸ§ª 5. Implementation

Hereâ€™s a quick sample using scikit-learn:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")

# Split features and labels
X = df.drop("Class", axis=1)
y = df["Class"]

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred))


---

ğŸ“¦ 6. Deployment (Optional)

You could deploy your model using:

Flask / FastAPI backend

Streamlit / Dash for dashboards

AWS / GCP / Azure for cloud-based deployment



---

ğŸ§  Want Deep Learning?

Use an Autoencoder to learn "normal" transactions and flag anomalies.

Would you like a full Python notebook template for this project? Or do you want help with a specific part like data balancing or model tuning?
